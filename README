How to use:

$('#MainWrapper').measureit();

Available Options:

$('#MainWrapper').measureit({
  onMeasurementBegin: null,
	onMeasurementEnd: null,
	enableHotkey: true,
	hotkey: 77, //Keyboard letter: m
	measurementSuffix: 'px',
	toggleElement: '#measurement-tool',
	toggleEvent: 'click'
});

There are two callbacks for you to utilize:
onMeasurementBegin
onMeasurementEnd

The measurement tool will be toggled by default by clicking on an element with the 'measurement-tool' id.
Those settings are configurable by passing in different options, as seen above.

By pressing and holding down CTRL+SHIFT+M this will toggle the measurement tool. The letter is also configurable.

That should be about all you need to know; enjoy!
